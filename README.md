# AI Snake Game using Deep Q-Learning

An AI-powered Snake game built using **Python**, **PyTorch**, and **Pygame**, where the snake learns to play the game by itself using **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)** â€“ a popular Reinforcement Learning technique.

## Features

- Trains an AI agent to play Snake autonomously
- Uses **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)** for decision making
- Real-time game visualization with **Pygame**
- Tracks score and plots learning curve using **matplotlib**
- Modular and easy-to-understand codebase

## Technologies Used

- Python
- PyTorch
- Pygame
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
